// If the dashboard service relies on req.user.id populated by middleware, we can't easily fake it without a token.
// However, I can temporarily modify dashboard.controller.ts to accept userId query param for debugging?
// Or I can modify the getStats call in the controller to hardcode the ID?

// Wait, the easier way is to rely on the frontend which IS making requests (status code 200 presumably, since no errors reported).
// If the frontend is making requests, the log SHOULD be there.

// I'll stick to checking the log first. If empty, I'll worry about triggering.
